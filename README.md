# 📡 Secure Your Own Wi-Fi Network

This repository contains all relevant files and documentation related to the **Wi-Fi Security Assessment** conducted as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship at Future Intern**. The task involved assessing the security posture of my personal home network by identifying potential weaknesses such as weak passwords, open ports, and unauthorized connected devices.

## 🎯 Task Objective

Conduct a security assessment of a home Wi-Fi network to evaluate its resilience against common threats, such as password vulnerabilities, exposed services, and unauthorized device access. Recommend mitigation strategies based on real findings.

## 🔧 What I Did

- Logged into the JioFiber router interface to check and verify encryption type, Wi-Fi password strength, and other security configurations.
- Used **Wireless Network Watcher** to scan for connected devices and detect unauthorized users on the network.
- Performed **Nmap** scans to identify open ports and services running on devices connected to the Wi-Fi network.
- Analyzed captured traffic using **Wireshark** to identify any unencrypted data transmission or suspicious activity.
- Compiled a professional report detailing vulnerabilities, screenshots of scans, and actionable security recommendations to enhance the home network's safety.
